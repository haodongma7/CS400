He picks that snake into his pocket and use his palms to warm that snake. When he arrived at home, he uses a towel to keep it from freezing. after a wile, the snake awakes. The farmer feed it with eggs and meat. But at night, the snake stares at the farmer and shows greed in its shining green pupils.

The snake sneak back to the raod after killing the farmer and get frozen again.
